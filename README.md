# rust_chip8

## Description:
A CHIP8 emulator, written in Rust.
Very much inspired by [codeslinger's](http://www.codeslinger.co.uk/pages/projects/chip8/) project. 

I'll be adding things that his code didn't have, e.g the missing gui programming and state saving.

## Usage: 
First, clone this repository:

    git clone https://github.com/benschau/rust_chip8/
  
Then, you can run the crate as usual:
  
    cargo run
  
## On CHIP 8 ROMS:
Don't ask for them. Illegal. Nuff' said. Find them on your own if you want them.
